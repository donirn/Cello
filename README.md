# Cello
iOS application for booking translator in Gothenburg, Sweden

We want to create a system to provide translator for anyone who does not speak swedish or english, but needs to come to public service, such as hospital and migration office.

Cello has 2 type of users: Customer and Translator. Below are the app flows for each.

## Customer
1. Customer can simply request to book translator and see if the request is pending or accepted.
2. Customer wait until the translator call on the booked time.
